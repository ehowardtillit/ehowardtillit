# Hi ! 

I'm Enrique, a longtime computer-music-politic geek. The goal of this doc is for my peers to get to know me better and set clear expectations about how it is to interact with me. I am an old-schooler. I started coding at around 8 and fell in love with it. Getting access to BBS's opened my mind further and the RTFM era helped me to learn how to deep-dive into many aspects of tech and science. I have had may roles, from dev, to engineer, to CTO, to manager. I have worked in very different settings, from start-ups and scale-ups to medium sized companies. I have worked in music streaming, publishing, had a (failed) web studtio, secure payments and card not present processing and edtech. I have worked with small (couple of thousands) and large (20+ Millons) volumes of traffic/MAU which brings very different issues but there is one constant: Working with humans. 

This is what i love in my current roles: Helping others, keeping people happy, excited to work on projects they like. Nothing to me is more meaningful than to have a positive impact on people. Tech is  means to a goal. It's nothing more than that. There is beauty in technology, as I beleive that what we do is a craft, but tech needs to be approached in a pragmatic and goal driven approach all the while striving for excellence in the implementation that we do.

As a general note and to get a gist of my core values and my working style: 
* I like to get things rolling and go beyond the goals we have set ourselves.
* I like to have open ad transparent communication. This means that if you think I/team/company is doing something wrong, not taking the right direction, please do tell.
* Say things as soon as possible. If we wait to say things, they fester and get worse.
* I love what I do and I am always looking for ways to get better.
* I like to measure things. I like stats, score cards and gloablly any tool that allows us to know where we are, how we are doing and how to get beeter.


## What I value
* Transparency
* Candor
* Trying your best
* Being open-mindend and good with other.

## What I don't have patience for
* Hidden agendas
* Not owning the desicions that are taken as a team or individually
* Not owning your mistakes
* Wasting time. Time is something we all lack so let's be mindful of our own time and others. Time is the fuel of work, so we need to be very effcient about it.

## How to best communicate with me
* I prefer to talk asynchornously
* I check my mail no more that 3-4 times a day
* I listen to loud music to concentrate, so I am easily starteled
* I tend to be verbose, so don't hesitate to gently stop me.

## Meetings
* Please try your best to set an agenda
* Keep to the time. This is something that I really dislike when meetings go over the time and the people involved don't at least ask if the person can stay.
* I try to keep meetings short. I usually have a 30 min limit. I rarely conduct more that 1 hour meetings.
* I like havin meeings outside of the office, be it for 1:1's or quick alignement chats. 

## Day to day management
* I prefer to orient stand-ups to resolve impediments you can have. This does not mean no to have a quick general updates so the other team members know what you are working on globally.
* I beleive that as long as you update the ticketing system and have quick chimes, there is no need for me to go and ask what you are doing
* I like to do quick chek-ups on each team member to have

## How to help me
* Give me clear expectations, align them to the true north and I will be happy

## What people misunderstand about me
* I look pissed when concentrated. Don't take it personally, It's just my face, inside their is usually a happy camper.
* I have ADHD so my head wonders a lot. I try to not go to far away, but if you see this, just kindly bring me back to earth.
* My dad-jokes are (somewhat) volountary
